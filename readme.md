# Cracking The Code Interview 6TH Edidtion
My python solution to CTC book problems.

My approach is not only to get the optimal solution, but I'm also trying to learn while coding and improve my way of thinking, so I write different functions to solve the problem not necessarily the best one. Also, I record my knowledge about python details that helps me calculate the BigO for my code accurately, which can be found in ["Things I learned so far"](Things-I-learned-so-far.md") with references to the information.
